       <h1>Statement</h1><p>
The world exists in three forms.  As unadulterated phenomena, as sets of pragmatic objects/concepts/divisions, and as a perceiving breathing mind. It pushes and pulls in a dialectic between its existence as raw experience and its existence as rigid parts. It is the part's prerogative to sever the rope and embrace only its conceptual prototypes. The phenomenal seeks to find pockets of deviation where prototypes bleed their colors. It wrestles with hands as foreign tongues, as the breathing mind inhabits the struggle.
        </p>
    
<p> I like to think of the work I make as relics of the coalescence of social and capital forces on the natural world. My main conceptual influence is philosopher Gottfried Leibnizâ€™s idealism. Loosely, the theory that every object and conglomerate of objects is a perceiving motivated mind that gives form to reality. In my work, I attempt to evince the motivations of represented landscape by using the earth as its own language. I am interested in the memory and drive of places entangled in socio political circumstance and gentrification and how these places would reform if suddenly isolated.</p>


    <p>In the context of ceramics I am interested in melt, rigidity, and raw material interaction. I am currently researching and developing new methods of forming including cast plaster-ceramic composite, bioplastic-ceramic composites for both tapecasting and structural foam, ceramic impregnated paper, ceramic printing, and molds based on photogrammetric reconstructions of objects/landscapes.</p>
    <p>In the context of software/sound/electronics I am interested in generative process and humanizing landscape/natural-data through the technological interface. I am currently researching machine learning, stochastic processes, radio transmission, and dehumidifiers.</p>
